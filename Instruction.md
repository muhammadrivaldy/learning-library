# Instructions for Using This Repository

## Purpose

This repository is designed for gathering and organizing theoretical knowledge in markdown format, with the goal of becoming an expert in a chosen field. Code explanations or snippets may be included in markdown files if necessary for understanding, but no dedicated code files are required. The notes can be periodically converted to PDF for offline reading.

## Workflow

1. Research and write theory notes in markdown files, organized by topic.
2. Periodically convert the markdown files into a single PDF for offline reading on your phone.
3. Use Copilot to help gather, organize, and summarize theory, suggest outlines, and expand topics as needed.
4. No need for dedicated code files; if code explanations or snippets help clarify theory, include them in the markdown notes.
